Billwise is a Splitwise client, acting as a Discord Bot, and is built to split, manage, and pay shared expenses between groups of people.<br><br>

> Vision: The bot utilizes Discord channels in lieu of Splitwise groups and allows you to create a shared expense that is primarily paid by an *expense handler.* The bot will notify the users of payments to be made at a specified interval and provide payment links to the expense handler of that particular expense in the group. You will either be allowed to directly pay the expense handler via payment methods that Billwise supports or manually record a cash payment.
